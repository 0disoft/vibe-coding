# Cookie and Similar Technologies Policy

> Last Updated: {{LAST_UPDATED}}


This policy is **part of the Privacy Policy** of {{SITE_NAME}} (hereinafter referred to as the "Company"). To provide a faster and more convenient website experience and to improve our services, the Company uses cookies and similar technologies.

## 1. What are Cookies and Web Storage?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device via your browser when you visit a website. Information stored in cookies is sent to the server when you revisit the website to identify you or maintain your settings.

In contrast, Web Storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, etc.) is a technology that stores data within the browser. This data is not automatically included in HTTP requests and is only transmitted to the server if the Company explicitly reads it via script and sends it. Since it has a larger capacity than cookies and is not sent with every network request, it is primarily used for storing display settings or temporary data.

Both cookies and Web Storage are technologies that store information on the user's device, and in some jurisdictions, they are subject to the same protection rules under relevant laws.

## 2. Types and Purposes

We use the following technologies to perform essential functions and enhance convenience:

### 2.1. Essential Cookies and Storage

These are strictly necessary for the core functions of the website. Without these technologies, basic services such as maintaining login status, page navigation, and processing payments cannot be used.

- Examples: Login session maintenance (Cookies), Security authentication tokens
- Retention Example: Most are deleted when the browser is closed or maintained for a limited period necessary for safe service operation. Specific retention periods are detailed in the Privacy Policy.

### 2.2. Functional & Performance Cookies

Used to remember your preferences or optimize website performance.

- Examples: Dark mode or light mode settings (Local Storage), Display language settings
- Retention Example: May remain until the user manually deletes them from the browser.

### 2.3. Marketing & Analytics Cookies

Used to analyze user interests or provide personalized advertisements.

- Current Status: We do not use marketing or targeting cookies to track user behavior or create individual user profiles.
- Principle: If we introduce analytics tools or advertising platforms (e.g., Google Ads) in the future, we promise to activate non-essential cookies only after obtaining prior user consent in accordance with applicable laws.

## 3. Third-Party Service Partners

We use professional external solutions for stable service operation. During this process, cookies or similar technologies provided by third parties may be stored on your device.
