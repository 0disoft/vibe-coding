> Last Updated: {{LAST_UPDATED}}

{{SITE_NAME}} (hereinafter "the Company") strictly complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable privacy laws. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the rights laid out below, and maintaining these rights is our legal obligation.

## 1. Your Rights (GDPR Art. 15-22)

You are entitled to exercise the following rights:

- **Right of Access (Art. 15)**: You have the right to request confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data.
- **Right to Rectification (Art. 16)**: You have the right to request the correction of inaccurate personal data concerning you.
- **Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten") (Art. 17)**: You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data under certain conditions (e.g., the data is no longer necessary, you withdraw consent, or the processing is unlawful).
- **Right to Restriction of Processing (Art. 18)**: You have the right to request the restriction of processing under specific circumstances (e.g., contesting the accuracy of the data).
- **Right to Data Portability (Art. 20)**: You have the right to receive the personal data provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit those data to another controller.
- **Right to Object (Art. 21)**: You have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes.
- **Right to Withdraw Consent (Art. 7(3))**: Where processing is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
- **Right to Object to Automated Decision Making (Art. 22)**: You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. You may request human intervention, express your point of view, and contest the decision.

> These rights may be limited in whole or in part where necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others or to comply with legal obligations.

## 2. How to Exercise Your Rights

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at:

- **Email**: [{{EMAIL}}](mailto:{{EMAIL}})

**Procedure and Timelines:**

- Requests to exercise your rights are processed **free of charge** in principle.
- We will respond to your request within **one month** of receipt.
- This period may be extended by **two further months** where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. We will inform you of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
- We may require **account login verification** or request the **minimum necessary additional information** to confirm your identity before processing your request.
- Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request. In case of refusal, we will provide the reasons and inform you of your right to **lodge an internal appeal** or **file a complaint with a supervisory authority**.

**Requests Through a Representative:**

- If you submit a request on behalf of another person, an **explicit power of attorney** and **proof of the representative's identity** are required.
- For legal guardians, proof of family relationship may be used instead.

## 3. Data Transfers Outside the EEA

As we operate globally, your personal data may be transferred to countries outside the EEA. In such cases, we ensure your rights are protected through:

- Transfers to countries with an **adequacy decision** from the European Commission.
- The execution of the **standard contractual clauses (SCCs, 2021 version)** approved by the European Commission.
- Conducting **Transfer Impact Assessments (TIA)** where necessary.

## 4. Lodging a Complaint

If you believe that our processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement.

- **EEA Supervisory Authorities**: [EDPB Members List](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en)
